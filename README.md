# Fast-Features: A Modular Approach to FastAPI Development

`fast-features` is a powerful toolkit for FastAPI projects designed to accelerate development by providing scaffolding, feature generation, and automatic discovery of project components. It promotes a modular and organized project structure, allowing developers to focus on business logic rather than boilerplate code.

## Why a Modular Structure?

As applications grow, maintaining a single, monolithic codebase becomes increasingly challenging. A modular, feature-based architecture offers several advantages:

*   **Scalability**: By organizing your code into self-contained features, you can easily scale your application by adding, removing, or modifying features without affecting other parts of the system.
*   **Maintainability**: A modular structure makes it easier to understand, debug, and test your code. Each feature has a clear responsibility, reducing cognitive load and simplifying maintenance.
*   **Separation of Concerns**: By separating your application into distinct features, you enforce a clean separation of concerns, leading to more robust and reliable code.
*   **Team Collaboration**: A modular architecture allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously with minimal conflicts, improving team productivity.

`fast-features` is designed to help you achieve these benefits by providing a solid foundation for building modular FastAPI applications.

## Key Features

*   **Project Scaffolding**: Kickstart your FastAPI project with a production-ready, modular structure in seconds. The `fastfeatures-scaffold` command generates a new project with a logical directory structure, including a core application setup and an empty `features` directory, ready for you to start building.
*   **Feature Generation**: Accelerate your development workflow by generating new features with a single command. The `fastfeatures-feature` command creates a new feature with a predefined structure, including models, services, and routes, so you can focus on implementing the business logic.
*   **Automatic Settings Generation**: Simplify your application's configuration with automatic settings generation. The `fastfeatures-settings` command generates a Pydantic `settings.py` file from your `.env` file, with support for nested settings, providing a type-safe and organized way to manage your application's configuration.
*   **Automatic Route Discovery**: `fast-features` automatically discovers and includes `APIRouter` instances from your features, so you don't have to manually wire up your routes. This reduces boilerplate code and ensures that your routes are always up-to-date.
*   **Automatic Model Discovery**: `fast-features` automatically discovers your `SQLModel` and `SQLAlchemy` models, making it easy to work with your database and ensuring that your models are always available when you need them.

## Installation

```bash
poetry add fast-features
```

## Getting Started

1.  **Create a new project:**

    ```bash
    fastfeatures-scaffold
    ```

2.  **Generate a new feature:**

    ```bash
    fastfeatures-feature
    ```

3.  **Enable route discovery in `app/main.py`:**

    ```python
    from fastfeatures.core.routes_discoverer import add_features_routes
    from app import features

    # ... (existing app setup)

    add_features_routes(app, features)
    ```

4.  **Run your application:**

    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload
    ```

## Usage

### Project Scaffolding

To create a new FastAPI project, use the `fastfeatures-scaffold` command. This command will prompt you for the project name and description.

```bash
fastfeatures-scaffold
```

This will create a new project scaffold in the current directory with the following structure:

```
<PROJECT_NAME>/
├── .env
├── main.py
└── app/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── core/
    │   ├── __init__.py
    │   ├── settings.py
    │   └── lib/
    │       ├── __init__.py
    │       └── database.py
    ├── features/
    │   └── __init__.py
    └── main.py
```

### Feature Generation

To generate a new feature, use the `fastfeatures-feature` command. This command will prompt you for the feature name.

```bash
fastfeatures-feature
```

This will create a new feature directory inside `app/features` with the following structure:

```
app/features/<feature_name>/
├── __init__.py
├── models/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   └── <feature_name>.py
├── routes.py
└── services/
    ├── __init__.py
    └── <feature_name>_services.py
```

### Settings Generation

To generate a `settings.py` file from your `.env` file, use the `fastfeatures-settings` command.

```bash
fastfeatures-settings --env-file=.env --output-path=app/core/settings.py
```

This will generate a `settings.py` file with nested Pydantic models. For example:

```python
# THIS FILE IS AUTO-GENERATED...

from pydantic_settings import BaseSettings, SettingsConfigDict

class Settings(BaseSettings):
    DATABASE_URL: str
    DEV_MODE: bool = False
    
    model_config = SettingsConfigDict(
        env_file=".env",
        env_file_encoding="utf-8",
        extra="ignore",
    )

settings = Settings()
```

### Route Discovery

To automatically discover and include all the `APIRouter` instances from your features, add the following to your `app/main.py`:

```python
from fastfeatures.core.routes_discoverer import add_features_routes
from app import features

# ... (existing app setup)

add_features_routes(app, features)
```

### Model Discovery

To automatically discover all your `SQLModel` and `SQLAlchemy` models, you can use the `get_sql_models` function. This is particularly useful for database migrations with Alembic.

```python
from fastfeatures.core.models_discoverer import get_sql_models
from app import features

# Discover all SQL models from the features module
sql_models = get_sql_models(features)
```

## The "Features" Concept

A "feature" is a self-contained unit of functionality that encapsulates a specific part of your application's domain. Each feature has its own models, services, and routes, promoting a clean separation of concerns and making your code easier to understand and maintain.

*   **`models`**: This directory contains the data models for your feature, defined using `SQLModel` or `SQLAlchemy`.
*   **`routes`**: This directory contains the API routes for your feature, defined using `FastAPI`'s `APIRouter`.
*   **`services`**: This directory contains the business logic for your feature, which is used by the routes to interact with the models and perform actions.

By organizing your code into features, you can build complex applications in a more structured and maintainable way.

## Alembic Integration

To use Alembic with `fast-features`, you need to configure your `migrations/env.py` file to automatically discover your models. Add the following code to your `migrations/env.py` file, just after the original `config = context.config` line:

```python
#### BEGIN OF CUSTOM CODE ####
from sqlmodel import SQLModel
from app.core.settings import Settings
from fastfeatures import get_sql_models
from app import features

get_sql_models(features)
config.set_main_option("sqlalchemy.url", Settings.DATABASE_URL)
#### END OF CUSTOM CODE ####
```
